definitely check it out! was a fun exercise.

## get started

1. clone the repository:
```shell
git clone git@github.com:williamgay25/micrograd.git
```

2. set up a python virtual environment and install the required packages by running the setup script:
```shell
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

3. if the virtual environment is not active, activate it:
```shell
source .venv/bin/activate
```

4. run the main.py script to train the net:
```shell
python main.py
```

5. when you're done, deactivate the virtual environment:
```shell
deactivate
```
